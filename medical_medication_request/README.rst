==========================
Medical Medication Request
==========================

The resource **Medication Request** represents an order or request for both
supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the
medication to a patient.

The resource **Medication Administration** describes the event of a patient
consuming or otherwise being administered a medication. This may be as simple
as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion. Related
resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific
encounter between patient and health care practitioner.
