# Vertical Medical

Vertical Medical provides a free open source solution for storing and processing medical
records in Odoo.

Many of the workflows were built in alignment with existing Odoo processes to allow for
seamless operation with other record types.

This project is moving towards organization and data models inspired by [HL7 FHIR v3](
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html).
