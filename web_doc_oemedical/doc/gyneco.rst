Gynecologist
============


Within the module there are 4 different tabs:

Gyneco
------
This first menu provides a general overview of the basic gynecological 
conditions of the patient. We can discriminate whether the patient is in a 
fertil age, is currently pregnant or is menopausal.

Screening
---------

Screening is a strategy used in a population to detect a disease in individuals
without signs or symptoms of that disease. These tests are performed on people 
without any clinical sign of disease. The intention of screening is to 
identify early disease in a community, thus enabling earlier intervention and 
management in the hope to reduce mortality and suffering from a disease.

Pap / Colpo
-----------

The PAP test is a screening test used to detect potencially pre-cancerous and 
cancerous processes in the endocervical canal of the female reproductive 
system. Many premalignant lesions and malignant lesions in these areas have 
characteristics that can be detected through a colposcopy examination.

Obstetrics
----------

This is a very complete menu that deals with the care of all women's reproductive tracts and their children through specific tabs of perinatal and puerperium info. This section considers important factors such as the number of pregnancies and prenatal evaulations, perinatal info, puerperium monitors or characteristics of the fetus.
