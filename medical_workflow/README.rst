Medical Workflow
================

The Workflow Module focuses on the coordination of activities within and
across systems.

In addition to the Task resource, this specification defines three logical
models - Definition, `Request <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html>`_ and
`Event <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/event.html>`_ that define the patterns for
resources that are typically involved in workflow. These patterns include
elements defining common attributes of each type of resource as well as
relationships between them.

Finally the `Plan definition <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html>`_
and `Activity definition <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/activitydefinition.html>`_
resources combine to support the creation of protocols, orders sets,
guidelines and other workflow definitions by describing the types of
activities that can occur and setting rules about their composition,
sequencing, interdependencies and flow.
