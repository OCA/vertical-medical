====================================
Medical Pathology - Import Interface
====================================

This module adds a wizard and an interface for the import of external pathology
data. Please note that it cannot handle imports on its own and must be extended
to support the desired data sources and code types with specific import logic.

Usage
=====

To access the wizard, go to
``Medical > Configuration > Pathology > Import Data``. For more info on
extending the interface to support a specific use case, please see the
documentation in the wizard model.
