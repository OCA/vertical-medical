=================
Medical Care Plan
=================

Describes the intention of how one or more practitioners intend to deliver
care for a particular patient, group or community for a period of time,
possibly limited to care for a specific condition or set of conditions.

Care Plans are used in many areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes.
They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when their
patient is next due for a tetanus immunization through to a detailed plan for
an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and
counseling with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals.

It captures basic details about who is involved and what actions are intended
without dealing in discrete data about dependencies and timing relationships.
