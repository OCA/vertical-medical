============
Medical Labs
============

This module allows for the workflows necessary for storing Medical Lab test
data.

Definitions
===========

* ``Lab`` - A Lab is an order for a set of tests, and an encapsulation of the results
  from those tests. This record contains no personally identifying data regarding who
  the Lab was performed on. A Lab is defined by its Lab Test Type.
* ``Patient Lab`` - A Patient Lab is a Lab, but also contains the information regarding
  the Patient that the Lab was performed on.
* ``Test Type`` - A Lab Test Type defines the Testing Criteria that should be applied
  to a Lab. An example of a Test Type is an STD Screening.
* ``Test Criterion`` - A Test Criterion defines the expected range, units, and description
  for Test Types. An example of a Test Criterion is an HIV Test, as part of an STD
  Screening Test Type.
* ``Test Result`` - A Test Result represents the results from a Test Criterion.

Usage
=====

Labs can be ordered and processed in the ``Patient Labs`` section of the ``Medical`` app.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add a lesser privileged user that can only see anonymized data.
* Add a menu for the anonymized data once safe to do so.
* Lab Reports in Patient More menu should be a smart button.
