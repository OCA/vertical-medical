============
Odoo Medical
============

This module extends Odoo with the base functionality of medical patients.

Installation
============

This module depends on modules located in the following repos:
* https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact

Check the ``__manifest__.py`` for the specific dependencies.

Usage
=====

Patients
--------

Patients are available in the ``Medical`` App, in the ``Patients`` submenu.

Medical Abstract Entity
-----------------------

The Medical Abstract Entity (``medical.abstract.entity``) is an AbstractModel
that provides for a central base that all medical entities should inherit from.

A Medical Entity is any partner that also requires a medical context. Examples:

* MedicalCenter
* MedicalPatient
* MedicalPhysician
* MedicalPharmacy

Some base views are also provided in order to make it easy to create new medical
entities & maintain uniformity between them:

* Kanban - ``medical_asbsract_entity_view_kanban``
* Tree - ``medical_asbsract_entity_view_tree``
* Form - ``medical_asbsract_entity_view_form``
* Search - ``medical_asbsract_entity_view_search``

When inheriting these views, you must define the inheritance mode as ``primary``,
such as in the following example:

    .. code-block:: xml

    <record id="medical_patient_view_tree" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">medical.patient.tree</field>
        <field name="model">medical.patient</field>
        <field name="inherit_id" ref="medical_abstract_entity_view_tree" />
        <field name="mode">primary</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <xpath expr="//tree" position="attributes">
                <attribute name="string">Patients</attribute>
            </xpath>
            <xpath expr="//field[@name='email']" position="after">
                <field name="identification_code" />
                <field name="age" />
                <field name="gender" />
            </xpath>
        </field>
    </record>

Take a look at ``medical/views/medical_patient.xml``, or any of the other medical
entity views for more examples.
